# User Group Raffle Management #

The problem with most user groups is the time it takes to handle the raffle process. This includes distributing tickets, drawing tickets and then ticket resolution, winner/prize logging and so on.

For some user groups this process takes upwards of 30 minutes because it's simply not optimized. 

## A streamlined solution ##
The aim of this project was to streamline the entire process to optimize the time it takes to run through the raffle. The system starts with user registration and ends with reports. 

###Registration###
When a user enters the meeting, they get registered via their name & email. If they are already registered, then it's a quick process. The member automatically gets a default number of raffle entries and they can negotiate more if necessary. Now all of the information is in the group's database for later use. 

###Raffle###
When it comes to the raffle, there are major issues with most groups. The first is drawing tickets. Tickets must be collected by the facilitator and then kept by the members. A random ticket is drawn from a hat and a number is read off. This process eats up much of the time as members have to be paying attention and they must resolve their ticket numbers. Some members purchase large quantities of tickets and some members leave before the raffle starts. 

Instead, this system simply pick's a random entry for an attending member and display's their name instead of a ticket #. It's instant recognition of the winner and if that member has left or not. No more waiting around.

After the winner is selected, they get to choose their prize and once they do, their information and prize choice is stored in the database. No more asking them what their name/email is which is usually a manual process. 

The raffle continues until there are no more entries or no more prizes.

###Reporting###
This solution proves various reports for group administrators including a raffle report that assists in sending sponsors the winner details.

Other reports include membership attendance which can be used to visualize trends.
